A [[https://github.com/kevinpt][guy]] wrote a great piece of software 8 years ago and, for whatever reason, left it behind. This is my experimental evolution of the original [[https://github.com/kevinpt/symbolator][symbolator]].

* Description
Nymbolator is a simple idea:

#+begin_center
/Take a design written in VHDL and draw it./
#+end_center

Expensive, closed-source giants like Vivado (AMD) and Quartus (Intel) have built-in schematic viewers, but they are heavy, slow, and locked behind gigabytes of installation files. Nymbolator tries to keep it lightweight and focused.

#+begin_center
/Because at the end of the day, it's just a plotter./
#+end_center

* Key Features
/Disclaimer: These features are not implemented in the usual common way yet. The parser exists, but it is not joined with the rest of the code and is currently very basic./

- *Simple:* Just C code.
- *Draws at block diagram Level.*
- *Lightweight:* No need to launch a multi-gigabyte IDE just to see your component's port map.
- *VHDL Parsing:* Automatically extracts entity signals and generics.

** Result
The =.vhdl= file used to generate the image is in the =media= folder. Check it out!

[[./media/diagram.svg]]

* Usage
The code always searches for a file called =top.vhdl= in the input folder.

#+begin_src bash
git clone https://github.com/rhyloo/Nymbolator.git
git checkout develop
mkdir bin
make
#+end_src

* FAQ

** Why did I start Nymbolator?
I wanted to understand and edit this repo: [[https://github.com/jasonsetiawan/ov7670_vga_Nexys2]]. I thought it would be great to have a tool that let me see how the module was done. I mean, I can draw manually and read the code, but if you can do something like =./plot_this=, I prefer it.

** Why in C?
I have two main reasons to use C:

- First, I had problems with Python and Symbolator. Since Python is part of Debian-based distros, installing a package like =pip install <package>= is a mess now. I mean, I don't want to create an environment for every code I write or test. Also, =--break-system-packages= is not a good solution; you are breaking something. I didn't want it for my project.

- Second, I wanted to practice my C skills and remember how pointers, opening files, etc., worked.

** Are you sure there aren't tools like this?
I think the answer is "no," unless I lost my search skills because of AI. If you have a tool suggestion, I am open to using it. Here are some links I visited before:

  - /Netlistsvg/ is at RTL level, I wanted something at block diagram level.
